# Filepicker

I was working on a project and discovered that I was missing a filepicker that would be flexible
and simple to work with. I ended up creating a simple filepicker which you can find here.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo
2. In your project: File -> New -> Import module find the repo on your system and select it
3. Change :app to :filepicker

You can look at the library's MainActivity, which was left in as an example of how you can use it.
